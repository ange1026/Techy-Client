### Project Journey

One of the first things that I did was call the NewsAPI on the front-end. The documentation was fairly easy I just had a little set-back when I was trying to connect it to the search bar, which was one of my next obstacles.

When trying to connect the api to the search bar I realized that it wasn't working because the search bar and the api were in a different set of components. After reading the docs and watching some tutorials I got it to work without me having to rearrange the components.
